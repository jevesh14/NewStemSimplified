          "Here's the kicker? This AI doesn't just speed things upâ€”it could completely change the game when it comes to how we fight infections.",
          "Because antibiotic resistance isn't some \"Future science problem.\"  It's a problem now. A problem why diseases like tuberculosis and staph infections are getting harder (and scarier) to treat",
          "And this tech?  It's like handing doctors a cheat codeâ€”an upgrade in how we understand and treat disease."

          "Think of GAM like that one friend who can spot drama from a mile away â€” it sees tiny clues in the DNA (mutations) and figures out if bacteria are about to cause trouble (resist drugs- which you should always do!)",
          "Wait, wait, but what even is antibiotic resistance?",
          "Well, here's a quick crash course:",
          "In the past, people could take antibiotics to treat diseases like tuberculosis (TB) and staph.",
          "Now they can't. Why?",
          "Over time, these bacteria have developed resistance to the drugs. How?",
          "Antibiotics kill most bacteria, but some survive due to mutations in their DNA (now this is the problem). These resistant bacteria then reproduce, creating more bacteria that the antibiotic can't kill. (Big Yikes!)",
          "This means the antibiotics that used to work no longer do, making it much harder to treat these diseases."

        content: [
          "Okay, imagine training a dog to do tricks",
          "The New Group Association Model (GAM) uses machine learning-  a branch of AI where a model is trained on a large set of data to perform a task without being programmed step by step. Think of it as the training part of training the dog.",
          "GAM uses machine learning to find genetic mutations linked to drug resistance (you know, the same kind of mutations I mentioned earlier, the ones that let some bacteria survive antibiotics.)",
          "Current tools are basic, they at known mutations and try to find the same mutation in the bacteria. This leads to errors, because they freak over harmless mutations believing they're the reason for antibiotics' resistance, just because they look similar to known ones",
          "GAM is way smarter.",
          "It looks through a large set of data (DNA) from different bacterias, and wether they are resistant to the antibiotic or not. It finds the pattern in which the mutations occur. GAM then compares bacteria with different resistance patterns to find genetic changes that show resistance to specific drugs."

          "Right now, other methods are slow, inaccurate, and miss rare mutations. While this treatment is proven to outperform WHO's current resistance detection.",
